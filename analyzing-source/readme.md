# Analyzing source
The PHP-script parse_elec.php will read the ELEC.txt in and output the JSON-Objects in an XML-Structure. (see ELEC_field.xml)
It just outputs the data with echo, so if you want a file you'll have to call the script via command line and redirect the output into a file.

This was just a tool to understand the file-structure at hand, and could be removed by now.
